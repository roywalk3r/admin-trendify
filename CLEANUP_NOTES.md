# Cleanup Notes - After Worker Thread Fix

## Optional: Remove Unused Dependencies

Since we've replaced `pino-pretty` with console logging in development, you can optionally remove it:

```bash
pnpm remove pino-pretty
# or
npm uninstall pino-pretty
```

**Note:** This is optional - leaving it installed won't cause issues, but it's no longer used.

---

## Verify the Fix

### 1. Restart Development Server
```bash
# Stop current dev server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Admin Pages
Navigate to these pages and verify no crashes:
- `/admin/coupons` - Try creating invalid coupon
- `/admin/reviews` - Test bulk actions
- `/admin/guests` - Search functionality
- `/admin/abandoned-carts` - Filter and sort

### 3. Check Console Output
You should now see clean logs like:
```
[INFO] HTTP Request { method: 'GET', url: '/admin/coupons', status: 200 }
[ERROR] Error occurred { err: ZodError, context: 'API Error Handler' }
```

### 4. Test Hot Reload
- Edit any file
- Save
- Verify: No "worker thread exited" errors

## What Changed

### Files Modified
1. `/lib/logger.ts` - Complete refactor
2. `/lib/api-utils.ts` - Added error handling
3. `/lib/monitoring/sentry.ts` - Prevented circular calls

### Files Created
1. `/docs/WORKER_THREAD_ERROR_FIX.md` - Full analysis
2. `/docs/CODEBASE_IMPROVEMENTS_OCT22.md` - Summary
3. `/CLEANUP_NOTES.md` - This file

## Production Deployment

### Before Deploy
```bash
# Run production build
npm run build

# Test production server locally
npm start

# Verify logs go to stdout (not worker threads)
# Check: No "worker thread" errors
```

### Environment Variables
No new variables needed. The fix works with existing config.

### Docker/K8s
If deploying with containers, logs will go to stdout as expected:
```bash
docker logs <container-id>
# Will show Pino JSON logs (production)
# or console logs (development)
```

---

## Rollback (If Needed)

Unlikely to be needed, but if issues arise:

```bash
git revert HEAD~3  # Revert last 3 commits
# Or restore from backup
```

---

**Status:** Fix complete and tested âœ…  
**Next:** Deploy to staging for full QA
