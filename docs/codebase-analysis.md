# Trendify Admin — Codebase Analysis and Audit

This document provides a deep-dive into the imported codebase, covering structure, stack, key functionality, patterns, dependencies, and actionable recommendations for maintainability, performance, and security.

---

## Executive Summary

- The project is a Next.js App Router application with an admin dashboard, authentication via Clerk, Prisma/PostgreSQL for data, and Appwrite for media storage.
- The API surface includes both public and admin endpoints, with middleware protecting admin routes.
- There are several duplications and inconsistencies (duplicate files, typos in filenames, type mismatches) that will hinder maintainability.
- Configuration issues (CORS applied globally, dual Next config files, invalid `images.remotePatterns` entry, ESLint disabled in builds, committed Prisma client) should be addressed before production. Following the Next.js Production Checklist will help ensure performance and security best practices are met. [^1][^3]
- Turbopack Dev is stable and can speed up local development; consider enabling and using bundle analysis for performance budgeting. [^2][^3]

## Tech Stack

- Framework: Next.js (App Router)
- UI: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + Lucide icons
- Auth: Clerk (middleware-protected admin routes)
- DB: PostgreSQL via Prisma
- Storage: Appwrite (image/media)
- Observability/Protection: Arcjet bot detection (DRY_RUN)
- Toasts: sonner
- Forms & Validation: react-hook-form + zod
- Fonts: next/font (Geist)

Recommendations about Images, Fonts, and Scripts should align with Next.js guidelines for production: use `<Image>`, the Font Module, and `<Script>` for third-party scripts. [^1][^3]
