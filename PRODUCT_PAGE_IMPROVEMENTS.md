## 🎯 Design Principles Applied

### 1. **Visual Hierarchy**

- Smooth transitions on all interactive elements
- Animated badges (pulse effect on discounts)
- Icon animations (star scaling, heart filling)

### 3. **Color Psychology**
- **Primary gradient** for prices (draws attention)
- **Yellow/orange** for ratings (warmth, trust)
- **Blue** for shipping (trust, reliability)
- **Green** for warranty (safety, approval)

### 4. **Spacing & Breathing Room**
- Increased padding (p-6 lg:p-10)
- Better gap spacing (gap-8 lg:gap-12)

### 5. **Typography Scale**

- Price: text-4xl lg:text-5xl font-black
- Rating: text-6xl lg:text-7xl font-black
- Consistent font weights (semibold, bold, black)

### 6. **Responsive Design**
- Mobile-first approach
- Hidden elements on small screens (breadcrumbs)
- Grid adjustments (lg:grid-cols-2, sm:grid-cols-2)
- Flexible button layouts (flex-col sm:flex-row)

### 7. **Accessibility**
