---

## ⚠️ Areas Needing Attention

### 1. **Review Approval Workflow** - ✅ FIXED

**Before:**
- ❌ Reviews submitted but never appeared (stuck at `isApproved: false`)
- ❌ No admin UI to approve reviews

**After (NEW APIs Created):**
- ✅ `POST /api/admin/reviews/[id]/approve` - Approve review
- ✅ `DELETE /api/admin/reviews/[id]/approve` - Reject review  
- ✅ `GET /api/admin/reviews/pending` - List pending reviews

**Next Step:** Create admin UI to use these APIs.

---

### 2. **Product Variants** - NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Schema Status:**
- ✅ ProductVariant model exists (fully defined)
- ❌ No API routes
- ❌ No UI
- ❌ Cart uses color/size strings instead of variantId
- ❌ OrderItem.variantId never populated

**Impact:** Can't properly handle products with multiple SKUs/variants.

**Recommendation:** 
- **Priority:** Medium (workaround exists with color/size fields)
- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks for full implementation
- **Current Workaround:** Using color/size string fields in CartItem

---

### 3. **Gateway Fee Storage** - MINOR ISSUE

**Current:**
- Gateway fee calculated in checkout
- Not stored in Payment.gatewayFee field

**Fix (Simple):**
```typescript
// In /app/api/orders/route.ts line ~342
await tx.payment.create({
  data: {
    orderId: newOrder.id,
    method: paymentMethod || "paystack",
    amount: newOrder.totalAmount,
    status: "unpaid",
    currency: "NGN",
    gatewayFee: new Decimal(gatewayFeeAmount), // ADD THIS
  },
})
```

**Priority:** Low (calculated at checkout, doesn't affect functionality)

---

### 4. **Abandoned Cart Email Sending** - PARTIAL

**Status:**
- ✅ Schema exists
- ✅ Cron job file created
- ✅ Detection logic written
- ❌ **Email sending marked as TODO**
- ❌ Cart creation not tracked

**File:** `/lib/jobs/abandoned-cart-recovery.ts`

**Fix Required:** Implement email sending in cron job.

---

### 5. **Driver Management** - NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Schema:**
- ✅ Driver model exists
- ✅ Order.driverId field exists
- ❌ No driver management APIs
- ❌ No driver assignment logic
- ❌ No UI

**Impact:** Manual order fulfillment required.

**Priority:** Medium (can be manual in early stages)

---

### 6. **Returns Management** - NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Schema:**
- ✅ Return model fully defined
- ❌ No API endpoints
- ❌ No UI
- ❌ Not integrated with Refund system

**Priority:** Medium (can handle manually initially)

---

### 7. **Audit Logging** - NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Schema:**
- ✅ Audit model fully defined
- ❌ **Never used in codebase**
- ❌ No audit trail for admin actions

**Impact:** No accountability for data changes.

**Priority:** High for production (compliance)

**Simple Implementation:**
```typescript
// lib/audit.ts
export async function logAudit(data: {
  userId?: string
  action: string // "CREATE", "UPDATE", "DELETE"
  entityType: string // "Product", "Order", "User"
  entityId: string
  oldValue?: any
  newValue?: any
  req: NextRequest
}) {
  await prisma.audit.create({
    data: {
      ...data,
      ipAddress: req.headers.get('x-forwarded-for'),
      userAgent: req.headers.get('user-agent'),
    }
  })
}

// Usage in API routes:
await logAudit({
  userId,
  action: 'UPDATE',
  entityType: 'Product',
  entityId: product.id,
  oldValue: oldProduct,
  newValue: updatedProduct,
  req
})
```

---

### 8. **Stock Alerts** - PARTIAL

**Status:**
- ✅ API exists (`/api/stock-alerts`)
- ✅ Users can subscribe
- ❌ **No automatic notifications** when stock replenished
- ❌ No admin notification when stock low

**Fix Required:**
```typescript
// In product update route, check if stock went from 0 to > 0
if (oldStock === 0 && newStock > 0) {
  const alerts = await prisma.stockAlert.findMany({
    where: { productId, notified: false }
  })
  
  for (const alert of alerts) {
    await sendStockAlertEmail(alert.email, product)
    await prisma.stockAlert.update({
      where: { id: alert.id },
      data: { notified: true, notifiedAt: new Date() }
    })
  }
}
```
