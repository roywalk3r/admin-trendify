# Test Suite Setup Instructions

## 🚀 Quick Setup

The comprehensive test suite has been created for Trendify. Follow these steps to get started:

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install the required testing dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will install:
- `jsdom` - DOM implementation for testing
- `happy-dom` - Alternative DOM implementation
- All existing testing libraries

### 2. Verify Installation

Check that all test dependencies are installed:

```bash
pnpm list vitest jsdom @testing-library/react
```

### 3. Run Tests

Now you can run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests once
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode (recommended for development)
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
pnpm vitest run --coverage
```

## 📝 What Was Created

### Test Files (25 total)
- ✅ **11 API tests** - Cart, products, checkout, reviews, etc.
- ✅ **4 Component tests** - UI components with user interactions
- ✅ **4 Utility tests** - Helper functions, store, validation
- ✅ **2 Hook tests** - Custom React hooks
- ✅ **2 Integration tests** - Complete user flows
- ✅ **4 UI tests** - Page components (already existed)

### Configuration
- ✅ `vitest.config.ts` - Test runner configuration with 80% coverage threshold
- ✅ `tests/setup.ts` - Global test setup (mocks, matchers)
- ✅ `.github/workflows/test.yml` - CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

### Documentation
- ✅ `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive testing guide (40+ examples)
- ✅ `tests/README.md` - Quick reference guide
- ✅ `TEST_SUITE_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation summary

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: `pnpm: command not found`

**Solution:** Make sure pnpm is installed:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Issue: PostCSS errors

**Solution:** The vitest config has been updated to disable CSS processing in tests with `css: false`.

### Issue: Tests not finding modules

**Solution:** Check that path aliases are working:
```bash
pnpm type-check
```

### Issue: Mock errors

**Solution:** Make sure to reset mocks in `beforeEach`:
```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  vi.resetModules()
})
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist
